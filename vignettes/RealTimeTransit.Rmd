```{r}

```

We can retrieve predicted arrivals at stops for both a single stop as well as for all stops within an operator system. 

For a single stop, we will directly call the stop prediction API. Data includes estimated arrival time, estimated vehicle position, as well as a timestamp of when estimates were last updated. 

```{r}
# Must specify operator ID and stop ID 
prediction <- get_realtime_predictions_for_stop(operator_id='AC', stop_id=53326)
prediction
```

To retrieve all stops for a particular operator, use the `get_realtime_predictions_for_operator(operator_id)` function. Note that default limiting is currently set to 1000 stops to help with API limits.
